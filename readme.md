Traffic Control System using AI and ML
Build Status

This project implements a traffic control system that uses AI and machine learning algorithms to manage traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.

Overview
Traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas, leading to increased air pollution, reduced quality of life, and economic losses. This project aims to address this problem by developing a traffic control system that uses AI and ML algorithms to manage traffic flow and reduce congestion.

The system uses computer vision to detect vehicles and track their movements in real-time. It then uses machine learning algorithms to analyze traffic patterns and predict congestion, allowing it to adjust traffic signals and route vehicles to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

Working
The project works as follows:

The system uses YOLOv8 to identify vehicles in real-time using computer vision.
Traffic density is calculated for each lane.
If there is higher traffic density, more green signal is allocated to that lane. Conversely, less green signal is given to less dense lanes.
Audio is extracted from the traffic environment and processed. If there is an ambulance frequency, the lane is prioritized.
Traffic violations such as over-speeding, wrong turns, riding without helmets, and line crossing are detected.
If any violation is detected, the license plate number is captured and an e-challan is generated and sent to the traffic control office.
The simulation allows users to observe the effects of the traffic control system on congestion and traffic flow in real-time.
Output
The program outputs a graphical representation of the traffic simulation, including the movement of vehicles and the state of traffic signals. The output can be viewed in real-time, allowing users to observe the effects of the traffic control system on congestion and traffic flow.

Simulation
The simulation allows users to test the traffic control system in a controlled environment, enabling them to evaluate its performance and make modifications as needed. The simulation includes various scenarios, such as rush hour traffic and incidents that disrupt traffic flow, allowing users to test the system's ability to respond to different conditions and provide real-time updates.
