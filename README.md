# Traffic Management using AI/ML

This project is designed to help manage traffic in large cities and make the roads safer for everyone. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to detect high traffic density, traffic violations, predict traffic patterns, and provide route suggestions. The project also includes ambulance detection and e-challan generation to make the roads safer for emergency vehicles.

## Overview

Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world. It not only causes long commute times and frustration for drivers, but also leads to air pollution and wasted fuel. This project aims to address these problems by using AI/ML to detect high traffic density, traffic violations, predict traffic patterns, and provide route suggestions.
